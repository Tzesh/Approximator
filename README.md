# Approximator

## What is Approximator?
Approximator is a basic Python program that approximates the y value according to given data (x and y values) with respect to x.
Approximator uses:
- Direct Method of Polynomial Interpolation,
- Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation, and
- Newton's Divided Difference Polynomial Interpolation.

## Usage
Just clone this repository, then adjust the x and y lists (in Approximator.py) according to your data, afterwards save it. Then run 'Approximator.py'. For each interpolation, a graph figure will be opened. And after you close each one the graphs will be saved into the same directory as 'Approximator.py'.
